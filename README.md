## About

Ice House allows you to easily and quickly initialize drives for use as backup and to create incremental
snapshots that are stored on them. For usage information, see `icehouse --help`.

Typically, you will want to run `icehouse init --drive /dev/sdx --pool backup` to initialize a new ZFS
pool on a drive. This process includes LUKS encryption, requiring a password during configuration. Once
initialized, you can begin backing up any system that uses ZFS by running
`icehouse backup --drive /dev/sdx --pool backup`.

## Try Without Installing

You can try Ice House without committing to installing it on your system by running the following command.

```bash
nix run github:snowfallorg/icehouse#icehouse
```

## Install Ice House

### Nix Profile

You can install this package imperatively with the following command.

```bash
nix profile install github:snowfallorg/icehouse
```

## Nix Configuration

You can install this package by adding it as an input to your Nix flake.

```nix
{
	description = "My system flake";

	inputs = {
		nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-22.05";

		# Snowfall Lib is not required, but will make configuration easier for you.
		snowfall-lib = {
			url = "github:snowfallorg/lib";
			inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
		};

		icehouse = {
			url = "github:snowfallorg/icehouse";
			inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
		};
	};

	outputs = inputs:
		inputs.snowfall-lib.mkFlake {
			inherit inputs;
			src = ./.;

			overlays = with inputs; [
				# Use the overlay provided by this flake.
				icehouse.overlay

				# There is also a named overlay, though the output is the same.
				icehouse.overlays."package/icehouse"
			];
		};
}
```

If you've added the overlay from this flake, then in your system configuration you can add the `snowfallorg.icehouse` package.

```nix
{ pkgs }:

{
	environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
		snowfallorg.icehouse
	];
}
```
